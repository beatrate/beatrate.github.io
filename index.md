### End of Days: Survival
[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/end-of-days-survival/id1478121968)

A card-based mobile game with RPG elements and branching stories.
Project included gameplay scripting, UI programming and tooling.
The project required creating quite a lot of custom UI components since the builtin layout components proved to be lacking when it comes to tricky responsive layouts.
The card game framework allowed authoring branching narrative embedded in cards with support for conditional choices, story variables and more.
