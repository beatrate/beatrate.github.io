### End of Days: Survival
A card-based mobile game with RPG elements and branching stories.
I was responsible for gameplay & UI programming.
The project required creating quite a lot of custom UI components since the builtin layout components proved to be lacking when it comes to tricky responsive layouts.
I also worked on custom tools for authoring branching narrative with support for conditional choices, story variables and more.

### Untitled color based game
This project was going to be based around the player bringing back color to the world.
It hasn't been developed further than shaders & custom light system prototype but it's still a possibility.

### Untitled bird game
This prototype was a continuation of the color based game.
The player would fly around an island plunged into darkness and light its countless lights and fires to bring back the dawn.
After implementing the custom light system along with aerial player controller the project was put on the back burner due to overwhelming scope of the environment.
