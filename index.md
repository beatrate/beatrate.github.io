## Projects

### End of Days: Survival
A card-based mobile game with RPG elements and branching stories.
I was responsible for gameplay & UI programming.
The project required creating quite a lot of custom UI components since the builtin layout components proved to be lacking when it comes to tricky responsive layouts.
I also worked on custom tools for authoring branching narrative with support for conditional choices, story variables and more.

### Untitled train game
A train management game with strategy elements.
Most of my work was centered around the event recording and time rewind systems.
Player was able play the game in realtime and manage train movement and railroad semaphores as the world state
was recorded into a timeline. At any point in time they could pause, unwind, rewind and fast forward the world state.
